information Confronted by this people often find it difficult to achieve their goal make an appointment submit an application or perhaps they are not able to find an answer because the website does not speak their language Some do not even manage to reach the site they want because they use a search term that the organisation concerned does not use e g a brand name that has become the generic term for something such as the kliko bins used in the Netherlands most local authorities do not use the term kliko br br Liverpool City Council UK has already introduced the top tasks approach and thus constitutes a good example for the Netherlands Top tasks are identified by researching which products and services people most frequently search for and what search terms they use Those products and services are then given a prominent place on the website For local authorities for example these tasks are likely to be associated with waste disposal and passports These tasks can also be made

planned reform activities is essential for an on going harmonization of the process enabling timely response and introducing corrective measures in case of any delays or discrepancies identified The monitoring system used for this process is based on regular processing of data collected from regular and interim reports The current system hasn t been sufficiently systemic it has been predominantly based on the ad hoc and inconsistent reporting and monitoring It is therefore necessary to develop a complete and efficient monitoring and evaluation system for the outcome of performed activities This principally implies the introduction of mandatory quarterly semi annual reports by all the actors which would be submitted to the competent Ministry After being processed by the competent Ministry they are discussed by the Inter ministerial Project group and then at higher levels of coordination of the implementation of the PAR Strategy With the aim of more comprehensive and objective data collection better information on the activities of CSOs that can contribute to reforms better flow of information to civil society about the activities of the state and monitoring of the

continuously monitor the situation and make efforts to implement the principle of transparency in all aspects of public administration Currently this area is regulated by the Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance Application of the Law led to the conclusion that it is neccessary to improve certain parts of the Law in order to overcome the obstacles to application and ensure

oversight it is necessary to pass a new law which will regulate this area on uniform basis and in a comprehensive manner The law will provide effective control of work quality of products and services and therefore contribute to the reduction of corruption and also grey economy The law will provide transparency of the inspection process as well as regulate data exchange between inspections by publishing all provisions legal acts and documents that are base for the inspection oversight and also by establishing the legal framework for efficient data exchange and exchange of electronic

incompatibility of functions However the issue of conflict of interest in terms of elimination of the influence of the private interest of the persons performing a public function has not been regulated properly which inhibits actions of the Agency Therefore it is necessary to specify and provide mechanisms for monitoring and consistent application of the provisions on the conflict of interest and increase accountability and transparency in actions In the field of control of assets and income of public high officials the Agency has faced difficulties related to the verification of accuracy and completeness of assets and income declarations and keeping a register The main deficiencies in practice are a loosely defined rights and obligations of a public high officials as well as

has been made on the revision of key mining contracts some work is still required on making lease agreements and contracts public in an effort to promote transparency and encourage civic participation

Department has embarked on a schools connectivity rollout project with telecoms operators as a start to ensure that we bring technology to learners This will be done in br br 2 phases whereby phase 1 will entail the connectivity to 1650 schools by savings achieved in the 2010 World Cup and phase 2 will be rolled out by telecoms operators under their Universal Service Obligations USO br br Phase 1 br br Financial savings has been achieved in the br br 2010 World Cup by Telkom The Department br br has requested that Telkom provide a model whereby schools will be connected with the financial savings derived As such the initial plan was to provide only internet connectivity to schools however the department realised that a turnkey solution would benefit the schools and learners better than just internet connectivity Department of Basic Education DBE then derived a hardware specification for the model which is to be implemented br br This then would ensure that schools would receive internet connectivity and hardware computers in the 1650 schools identified Further to this DBE will be developing an internet portal for education thus allowing learners and teachers to access educational content br br Any solution is never complete without ICT training hence the department intends to provide free ICT training to teachers thus empowering them to be able to use the technology provided and also pass on this knowledge to learners This rollout is intended to start in the current financial year and will span for 2years thereafter br br Phase 2 br br In order for telecoms operators to be given a license community obligations regarded as Universal Service Obligations USO were imposed on them to fulfil One such obligation is providing connectivity to schools Each operator was allocated a number of schools to connect which ICASA had to allocate and manage br br Providing connectivity without hardware computers is futile hence ICASA will be in the process

Standard so that UK assistance can be tracked through the delivery chain , Increasing the transparency and traceability of development spending has the potential to transform the way aid is delivered globally and to improve its impact Making information about aid spending easier to access understand and use means that taxpayers in donor countries and citizens in developing countries can more easily hold governments to account for using funds wisely It also enables international development actors to coordinate and plan their activities more effectively As the UK achieves the milestone of providing 0 7 of Gross National Income on development assistance from 2013 this greater transparency and openness is a crucial element of helping to ensure we get best value for every pound spent br br Achievement of this commitment will result in more UK data on development assistance being published and available in a common format to an internationally recognised standard We will also

The UK government will for the first time bring together all of the UK s anti corruption efforts under one cross government anti corruption plan , The UK s work so far has sought to address corruption both at home and abroad The UK government takes the issue of preventing and dealing with corruption where it occurs both at home and overseas very seriously Over recent years the UK has taken a number of steps to deal with corruption and we have good structures and legislation already in place including br br the Bribery Act 2010 which is a world leading piece of legislation reforming criminal law

Spring countries br br Even with this activity taking place we recognise that there is more that can be done to improve our standing at home and to better manage our reputation for dealing with corruption and bribery offences overseas To do this the UK government will for the first time bring together all of the UK s anti corruption efforts under one cross government anti corruption plan The plan will bring greater coordination and effectiveness to the UK s efforts to tackle corruption both domestically and internationally across government and its agencies and with civil society business and international institutions Non governmental organisations NGOs and civil society organisations CSOs will be consulted for their views on the content of the plan br br The plan will include a range

publicly accessible central registry of company beneficial ownership information The registry will contain information about who ultimately owns and controls UK companies , A lack of knowledge about who ultimately controls owns and profits from companies and legal arrangements facilitates their misuse for illicit purposes including tax evasion money laundering corruption and bribery br br The UK is committed to lead by example to implement international standards on transparency of ownership and control to tackle the misuse of companies and legal arrangements In particular the UK has committed to place a requirement on companies to obtain and hold adequate accurate and current information on their beneficial ownership defined as the natural person s who ultimately owns or controls a legal person or arrangement br br Company beneficial ownership information will be held in a central registry maintained by br br Companies House The UK sought views on whether information in the registry should be made br br publicly accessible A large number of respondents to the consultation supported this in the interests of promoting positive corporate behaviour and transparency though concerns were also expressed notably around competitiveness impacts and privacy Having carefully br br considered the arguments for and against the UK has committed to making information on br br individuals with significant interests in UK companies accessible publicly via Companies House potentially using as a model the type of information already in the public domain on company shareholders br br As we further develop the policy we will give careful consideration to br br how we can best protect individuals who might be at risk of harm through disclosure of this br br information br br the sanctions that will apply if individuals or companies deliberately provide false br br information or fail to provide information br br how the registry will operate in practice br br This will help ensure the robust implementation of the new requirements br br In parallel the UK is taking forward related G8 commitments to enhance corporate transparency and has sought views on the following issues br br the prohibition of new and existing bearer shares which allow company shares to be traded anonymously br br enhanced transparency around the use of nominee directors which can be used to conceal who really controls a company br br the prohibition of corporate directors which can be used to create an opaque corporate structure br br Furthermore we continue to pursue the same level of ambition through the EU G8 and the br br G20 All G8 countries have published action plans on beneficial ownership The G20 also br br declared at St Petersburg this year that they too will lead by example on implementation of beneficial ownership requirements and G20 leaders have tasked finance ministers to update the G20 next year on steps taken to meet the relevant international standards In the EU the UK is continuing to push for an ambitious approach in the context of proposals for a Fourth EU Money Laundering Directive br br Through the UK s G8 action plan on beneficial ownership the UK is taking forward a number of other commitments We are currently undertaking the UK s first ever national risk assessment of money laundering and terrorist financing threat to be completed in 2014 We also committed to improve the supervision and enforcement of those that facilitate company formation in the UK HM Revenue and Customs HMRC are currently leading a review of supervision and enforcement of trust and service providers which will include consideration of additional measures to ensure company formation agents conduct effective due diligence including the identification and verification of beneficial owners We will also take forward work in the context of the national risk assessment to assess the money laundering and terrorist financing risk posed by trusts and through the Fourth EU Money Laundering Directive we will seek to ensure that trustees of express trusts are obliged to obtain and hold adequate accurate and current information on beneficial ownership regarding the trust Furthermore we are working hard in the OECD to establish a new global standard on automatic exchange of information which the G20 has called for by February 2014 This will provide greater transparency over trusts than ever before providing the authorities with more information to tackle the misuse of trusts br br Timescales The government discussion paper relating to these

bringing police force records under legislative control by adding police forces to the Public Records Act 1958 alongside other options that may not require legislation The working group will report with a clear proposal and action plan by 30 June 2014 , If police records were brought into the public records system police bodies would be required to review their records and transfer those selected for permanent preservation to a place of deposit by the time that they are 30 years old reducing to 20 years over the next decade in order to ensure their long term preservation and public
